What if you wanted to create a parent class that was really a template of a class? First, let me provide an example of why you would want to do this. Let's take the example of a recipe for making a cake (your parent class). You might want to create a recipe, and include a step to put in all your flavorings, but leave the implementation of these flavorings up to the user. In your recipe, you would reference adding your flavorings, but you would not specify what to add. In a similar way, abstraction allows you to create methods that you might use via other methods in your parent class, but wait until creating child classes to implment their specifics. Let's see what this entails before considering a more real-world example."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WCR3zh9kFG5x"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Run this code to load the class\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","from datetime import date\n","\n","class Experiment(ABC):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, path_to_expt, expt_date, experimenter):\n","        self.path_to_expt = path_to_expt\n","        self.expt_date = expt_date\n","        self.experimenter = experimenter\n","        self.generated_date = date.today()\n","\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def print_expt_info(self):\n","        pass"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EtUtf4XoFG5x"},"source":["Check out that @abstractmethod tag we used: this will tell python that this is an abstract method that can not be used on its own.
