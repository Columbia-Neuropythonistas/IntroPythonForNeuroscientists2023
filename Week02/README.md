# Week 2 -- Intro to Python Part 1

## Pre-Work
Like last week, if you run into issues please contact us before class. Please upload a screenshot of the problem you are running into to the relevant assignment on courseworks so we can help you debug.

### 1. Navigate to your git repo
- If you were able to `git clone` successfully during or after class, use `cd` and `ls` in terminal to navigate to your github repository on your computer.
- If running `git status` gives you an error like this: ```fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git```, you are not in your git repository, and either still need to navigate to it, or you may not have successfully run `git clone` during class.
- If you were unable to run `git clone` successfully during or after class, please do so now.
  - Go to your repository by going to [github](github.com), clicking on your profile picture at the top right, clicking "My Repositories" and then clicking the repository you made for class.
  - Click on the green button labeled "Code", make sure ssh is selected, and copy the link to the repository -- mine is "git@github.com:syncrostone/IntroPythonExample.git"
  - Go to terminal (git bash in windows) and run `git clone <your-url>`, so I would run `git clone git@github.com:syncrostone/IntroPythonExample.git`. 
- Run `git status`, take a screenshot of the result, and upload it to the assignment on courseworks.

### 2. Create a jupyter notebook and commit it to your git repo.
- See the video linked in the assignment, and submit a link to the ipynb file in your github repo at the end.

### 3. Watch a short video to prepare for class (and remember to watch last week's video if you forgot to).
