# Week 2 -- Intro to Python Part 1
## Optional Video on Conda environments and Jupyter Notebook Intro

[Video linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCOINLVBVmM)
### Optional extra credit work:
1. Create and run a jupyter notebook, ensuring you have selected the “intropython” environment kernel

2. Create and run 3 cells, making sure none of them output errors:

i. markdown cell
```
# hello world
```

  ii. code cell 

      print(‘hello world’)

  iii. code cell 

      import numpy

3. Save notebook as “helloworld.ipynb”. Take a screen shot of the notebook after executing all the cells and include in your Week02 coursework assignment for extra credit.



## Pre-Work
Like last week, if you run into issues please contact us before class. Please upload a screenshot of the problem you are running into to the relevant assignment on courseworks so we can help you debug.


### 1. Download the IntroPython1.ipynb file from this repository folder (Week02).
Please save it in your intro2python folder.
### 2. Commit the  IntroPython1.ipynb to your own intro2python repository.
Feel free to do it via Visual Studio Code or via git. I won't put instructions here on the exact commands, so try to jog your memory (or revisit the slides)!
### 3. Take a screenshot of your intro2python repository with the IntroPython1.ipynb and upload it to the Courseworks Assignment.
